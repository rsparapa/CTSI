\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{\bf\textcolor{blue}{Honest Broker}}

\begin{itemize}
\item What is an {\it honest broker}?
\item
``A neutral intermediary ... between the individual whose ... data are being studied, and the researcher. The honest broker collects and collates pertinent information ... replaces identifiers with a code, and releases only coded information to the researcher.''
 \textcolor{PineGreen}{[\href{https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/sachrp-committee/recommendations/2011-october-13-letter-attachment-d/index.html}{US
     HHS FAQ}]}
\item CTSI Biomedical Informatics is the Honest Broker!
\item The term originated in diplomacy meaning an entity
accepted by all sides in a negotiation as impartial
\item German Chancellor Otto von Bismarck was the first to use the
  term, by applying it to himself, as an intermediary in negotiations
  between Russia and the Ottoman Empire (Auray-Blais and Patenaude,
  BMC Medical Ethics 2006)
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{\bf\textcolor{blue}{De-identification}}

\begin{itemize}
\item All HIPAA identifiers are de-identified by the Honest Broker
\item For example, patient names, etc.\ are removed
\item Spatially, we have state of residence and\\
ZIP code is shortened to 3 digits 
\item The Medical Record Number (MRN) is replaced by
the variable \textcolor{red}{\texttt{patient\_hash}} which is a double
encrypted key 
\item \textcolor{red}{\texttt{patient\_hash}} is unchanging so that
the MRNs could be retrieved if you have IRB approval for identified
data
\item All dates for each patient are de-identified by a\\
\textcolor{blue}{single} random integer from -10 to 10 (with zero excluded)

\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{\bf\textcolor{blue}{Death and Cause
      of Death}}

\begin{itemize}
\item Death is available
\item However, it may not be trustworthy
\item It is common to see EMR data far beyond the death date
\item Also, Cause of Death is not available
\item It can be acquired from the state of Wisconsin\\
or the US CDC National Death Index (NDI)
\item Typically, NDI is about two years behind
\item Complete data for 2020 was released in 01/2022
\item Early release for 2021 in 01/2022 was about 98\% complete 
\item Of course, it costs money
\item And the caveats about cause of death are substantial
\item \textcolor{PineGreen}{[\href{https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/ndi/index.htm}
{US CDC NDI}]}
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{\bf\textcolor{blue}{Comma Separated Values}}

\begin{itemize}
\item A data exchange format that goes back to the early 1970's
\item Popularized by spreadsheets in the 80's and 90's
\item What we have today was solidifed by about 2005 
\item Standards include RFCs 4180 and 7111 among others
\item See \textcolor{PineGreen}{[\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values}
{``Comma-separated values'' on Wikipedia}]}
\item Typically, a three-letter file type of ``csv'',
e.g., ``Book1.csv''
\item A text file where each field is separated by commas
\item A missing value is nothing: two consecutive commas
\item Fields with commas are encased in double-quotes
\item Double-quotes are escaped by doubling them (like SAS does)
\item Double-quotes around numbers (or anything) is read as text 
\item Although, a standard there are edge cases that can't be
  {\it automatically} read by common software such as R and/or SAS
\item Furthermore, spreadsheets are very lax: columns can be a mixture of numbers and text that will cause havoc when read
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{\bf\textcolor{blue}{Comma Separated Values}}

\begin{itemize}
\item If CSV files have so many challenges, then why bother?
\item No other data exchange formats have caught on
\item Alternatives like XML are even worse!
\item With respect to CSV, SAS fills an important niche
\item SAS makes the exchange of CSV files with dates, times
and date-times effectively trivial
\item This is a very important concern since the EHR is rife
with chronological info: so much so that you don't even want to
consider making their transfer manual in any shape or form
\item And we have decades of experience with CSVs
\item Largely automated functions roughly in order of usefulness
\item SAS: \texttt{PROC IMPORT}/\texttt{PROC EXPORT}
\item R functions: \texttt{read.csv()}/\texttt{write.csv()}
\item RASMACRO: \texttt{\_cimport}/\texttt{\_cexport}\\
plus \texttt{\_crepair}, \texttt{\_constant}
and \texttt{\_verify} for handy features
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{\bf\textcolor{blue}{A brief introduction to SQL}}

\begin{itemize}
\item Structured Query Language (SQL) 
\item The syntax/semantics for interacting with\\
relational database management systems
\item Originally developed by IBM: now an industry standard
\item \textcolor{PineGreen}{[\href{https://www.iso.org/standard/63555.html}
{SQL:2016 AKA ISO/IEC 9075:2016}]}
\item On the TIOBE Index of programming language popularity (circa 04/22)
\item SQL is ranked 9
\item First appeared in 1974
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{\bf\textcolor{blue}{A brief introduction to R}}

\begin{itemize}
\item The R language is an open-source free software GNU project\\
 purpose-built for data science with {\it objects}
\item \textcolor{PineGreen}{[\href{https://R-project.org}{https://R-project.org}]}
\item \textcolor{PineGreen}{[\href{https://CRAN.R-project.org/manuals.html}{https://CRAN.R-project.org/manuals.html}]}
\item Naturally vectorized language with convenient objects such as vectors,
matrices and \textcolor{red}{\texttt{date.frame}}'s
\item On the TIOBE Index of programming language popularity (circa 04/22)
\item R is ranked 11 
\item A derivative of S which first appeared in 1976
\item Many free add-on packages
\item 18991 available on the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) (circa 04/22)
\item \textcolor{PineGreen}{[\href{https://CRAN.R-project.org}{https://CRAN.R-project.org}]}
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{\bf\textcolor{blue}{Accessing the database with R}}

\begin{itemize}
\item Via \textcolor{red}{\texttt{DBI}} package and the 
\textcolor{red}{\texttt{RPostgres}} backend from CRAN 
\item Use your MCWCORP credentials to login at 
\textcolor{PineGreen}{[\href{https://jupyter.ctsi.mcw.edu}{https://jupyter.ctsi.mcw.edu}]}
\item BUT YOU HAVE A SEPARATE \textcolor{blue}{\texttt{JHUSERNAME/JHPASSWORD}}
\end{itemize}
\begin{verbatim}
user="JHUSERNAME" 
password="JHPASSWORD"

    bigint="integer"
)
\end{verbatim}

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{\bf\textcolor{blue}{A brief introduction to SAS}}

\begin{itemize}
\item The SAS language is a proprietary for-fee fourth-generation\\ domain-specific environment for data science
\item \textcolor{PineGreen}{[\href{https://SAS.com}{https://SAS.com}]}
\item \textcolor{PineGreen}{[\href{https://support.sas.com/en/documentation.html}{https://support.sas.com/en/documentation.html}]}
\item Convenient naturally vectorized \texttt{DATASTEP} language 
\item You don't buy SAS, you rent it annually June to May
\item MCW has a site-license: for students it is free
\item Use the IS ticket system to order
\item On the TIOBE Index of programming language popularity (circa 04/22)
\item SAS is ranked 21 
\item First appeared in 1972
\item The \texttt{RASMACRO} collection of my GPL SAS macros 
\textcolor{PineGreen}{[\href{https://github.com/rsparapa/rasmacro}{https://github.com/rsparapa/rasmacro}]}
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{\bf\textcolor{blue}{A brief
introduction to SAS}}

\begin{itemize}
\item Why not just use R instead of SAS?
\item R's strengths are not within data processing
\item For example, R does not have warnings about non-unique keys
whereas SAS does (always check your \texttt{.log} !)
\item What is a unique key?
\item Suppose your SSN is unique, does that make it a unique key?
\item NO, not necessarily
\item Consider a table consisting of everyone's lifetime annual
  earnings where each row/record is a year for a given SSN?
\item What is the unique key on this table?
\item It is SSN AND year: NOT SSN alone!
\item The R function \texttt{byvalue} adds SAS-like
automatic variables but it is not the same as the real
thing with WARNINGS
\item For virtually all tables in the CRDW, the unique key
is not obvious and often surprising: SAS is much better suited to this
\item You have been forewarned
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{\bf\textcolor{blue}{RASMACRO}}
\begin{itemize}
\item SAS has a powerful macro language
\item RASMACRO is GPL library at 
\textcolor{PineGreen}{[\href{https://github.com/rsparapa/rasmacro}{https://github.com/rsparapa/rasmacro}]}
\item It is available on the Biostatistics Cheese Cluster
and the Research Computing Center cluster
\item But anyone can install it
\item Very useful to working with CRDW data 
\item \texttt{\_verify} to automatically convert {\it character} fields to numeric if possible,
i.e., some fields are unnecessarily encoded as text
\item \texttt{\_constant} automatically drops variables that are constant including missing
\item \texttt{\_crepair} for CSVs with very long variable strings, R has an esoteric format
that needs to be re-formatted so SAS can read them automatically
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{\bf\textcolor{blue}{RASMACRO}}
\begin{itemize}
\item Installing RASMACRO is fairly trivial on Windows and Linux
\item Get it from github in a directory called \texttt{rasmacro}
\end{itemize}
\texttt{git clone https://github.com/rsparapa/rasmacro.git} \\
To get updates: \texttt{cd rasmacro; git pull} \\
Add these lines to your \texttt{sasv9\_local.cfg} \\
where \texttt{RASMACRO} is the path to your directory 
\begin{verbatim}
/* ' these are single quotes as LaTeX renders them */
-sasautos ('!SASROOT/sasautos' 'RASMACRO') 
-set SASAUTOS ('!SASROOT/sasautos' 'RASMACRO')
\end{verbatim}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{\bf\textcolor{blue}{Hands-on with Jupyterhub}}
\begin{itemize}
\item Login \textcolor{PineGreen}{[\href{https://jupyter.ctsi.mcw.edu}{https://jupyter.ctsi.mcw.edu}]}
with your MCWCORP credentials, i.e., same as Outlook/etc.
\item And use your \texttt{JHUSERNAME/JHPASSWORD}

\begin{itemize}
\item You can download your CSV files: DEMO
\item However, due to IRB restrictions, you may not download data
for more than 9999 patients
\item And you can process them with R
\item R will convert character to numeric values where possible
\item Except that it handles dates as character by default!
\item There is no automatic detection: that is a manual process
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{\bf\textcolor{blue}{CSV processing with SAS}}
\begin{itemize}
\item SAS does NOT automatically convert character to numeric
\item However, the RASMACRO \texttt{\_verify} can handle that
\item SAS does automatically detect dates, times and datetimes!
\item Also, the RASMACRO \texttt{\_constant} automatically detects
variable/columns that are a constant value (including missing) and
removes them
\item In this case, the following were superfluous and removed
\item \texttt{mult\_tum\_rpt\_as\_one\_prim, multiplicity\_counter, 
cs\_tumor\_size, cs\_lymph\_nodes, cs\_mets\_at\_dx, cs\_mets\_at\_dx\_bone, 
cs\_mets\_at\_dx\_brain, cs\_mets\_at\_dx\_liver, cs\_mets\_at\_dx\_lung, 
sequence\_number\_hospital}
